## Project Short Description
The project is a Minesweeper dApp developed on zkSync Era, combining a classic game with blockchain technology. Thanks to zkSync, privacy is a central aspect: the location of the mines remains hidden, even from the system, ensuring a secure and fair gameplay experience while still being transparent as everything is decentralized. It also has low costs, allowing for multiple interactions with the game without worrying about high fees.

## Project Vision
To be a leader in decentralized gamification, demonstrating how traditional games can integrate with blockchain to offer privacy and low fees, with the potential to incorporate economic rewards through tokens.

## Features
The contract for distributing prizes was developed, but due to network issues, it couldn't be deployed.

## Installation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
